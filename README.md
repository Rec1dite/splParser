# SPL Parser

> A simple parser for SPL (Student Programming Language), a fictitious programming language invented by my professor, [Prof G](http://www.stefan-gruner.de/) (See `grammar.txt`).
>
> The program takes as input a set of SPL/TXT files, and outputs the corresponding abstract syntax tree (AST) in XML format.

To run the code, make sure that the requirements are installed through pip: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To parse files in bulk, place all input files within the `inputs/` folder (See `(1)` below)

`pars.py` can be run as follows:
```bash
    # 1) To parse all files in the inputs/ folder
    python3 pars.py

    # 2) To print a basic help message
    python3 pars.py -h

    # 3) To parse a specific file
    python3 pars.py -f relative/path/to/yourFile.txt
```

For input files in `inputs/`, the final XML output will be written to `outputs/yourFile.xml`.
